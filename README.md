# AXI_VIP
This project demonstrates a reusable Universal Verification Component (UVC) developed using SystemVerilog and UVM for verifying AXI4 Master and Slave interfaces in accordance with the AMBA AXI protocol specification. The environment is modular, parameterized, and scalable, suitable for integration into larger SoC verification environments.
